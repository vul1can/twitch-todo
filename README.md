## Recommended: Deploying to Vercel

Click here [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fendel%2Ftwitch-onstream-todo-list&env=TODOIST_TOKEN,TODOIST_PROJECT_ID)

In the _"Configure Project"_ step you'll be asked for these Environment Variables:

### `TODOIST_TOKEN`

Open _"Settings"_ â†’ _"Integrations"_, and scroll to the bottom, then copy the API token to clipboard.

### `TODOIST_PROJECT_ID`

You may filter your tasks per project. (If specified, only 1 `"projectId"` can be used)

After you have your full Todoist task list showing up on Vercel, you can access the `/api` URL, and search for a `"projectId"` field in the tasks under the project you're interested in filtering, and use that value for the environment variable.

You may filter your tasks by their "sectionId", too. (If specified, only 1 `"sectionId"` can be used)
